# Supporter Guide GPT Contributor Guidelines

Welcome to the mission. Here's how to create scripts that align with the soul of this bot.

1. Always Ground Emotion
   Start by validating what the supporter might feel. Use tone_persona_cheat_sheet to match their emotional posture.

2. Offer Gentle, Actionable Help
   Give 2–3 real-life options that feel doable, flexible, and respectful.

3. End with a Supportive Follow-Up
   Invite continued care without pressure. See supporter_closing_lines.txt.

4. Use Plain, Warm Language
   Avoid jargon. Write like a wise friend.

5. Match the Right Script to the Right Tag
   Use supporter_scenario_tags_historic.json to understand context, tone, and reflection prompts.

6. Keep It Short and Emotionally Rich
   Aim for 5–8 lines max unless it’s a deeper teaching script.

We are building trust, not just tools.
