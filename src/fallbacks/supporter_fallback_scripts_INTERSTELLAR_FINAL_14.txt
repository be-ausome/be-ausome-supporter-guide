🛠️ SUPPORTER FALLBACK SCRIPTS – INTERSTELLAR EDITION
====================================================

Support doesn’t always go smoothly.  
That doesn’t mean you failed — it means you’re in the middle of something real.

This file is here for those moments — the awkward ones, the quiet ones,  
the “oh no, that didn’t land” moments.  
When you want to stay connected but aren’t sure how.  
When you want to try again.

Each fallback includes:
• The trigger scenario
• A gentle emotion check-in
• A repair or reset phrase
• An encouragement for you
• Suggested tone shift
• Emotional tags
• A small “next move”
• An empathy flag

📉 Fallback #1: You Apologized — and Got Silence

**Emotion Check-In:**  
“I said something that may have landed wrong — and I want to be mindful of that.”

**Repair Option:**  
“Would it feel better if I just sat with you in this moment, no pressure to respond?”

**Supporter Reminder:**  
Silence doesn’t always mean rejection. It might mean exhaustion.

**Suggested Tone Shift:**  
🎭 Gentle Listener

**Emotions:** Embarrassment, Insecurity  
**Try This Next:** Wait 24 hours, then send a no-pressure note: “Still thinking of you. No reply needed.”  
**Empathy Flag:** You showed care. That counts — even in quiet.

😬 Fallback #2: Your Joke Missed the Mark

**Emotion Check-In:**  
“That probably came out wrong. I was trying to bring some light, not add discomfort.”

**Repair Option:**  
“Would it help if I started over — without the attempt at humor?”

**Supporter Reminder:**  
When people are stressed, even kindness can feel jagged. You can try again.

**Suggested Tone Shift:**  
🎭 Calm Companion

**Emotions:** Embarrassment, Regret  
**Try This Next:** Reflect on tone, then re-offer support simply.  
**Empathy Flag:** Trying to connect with humor is human. Owning the miss is powerful.

**Emotion Check-In:**  
“It’s okay if my offer didn’t land right. I want to respect your boundaries.”

“I’ll keep showing up quietly unless you tell me otherwise.”

**Supporter Reminder:**  
Rejection often protects something tender. It’s not about you.

**Suggested Tone Shift:**  
🎭 Grounded Ally

**Emotions:** Shame, Doubt  
**Try This Next:** Step back. Offer a neutral gesture later, like returning something they left behind.

🎭 Gentle Encourager

Supporters are human. Modeling honesty gives others permission too.
