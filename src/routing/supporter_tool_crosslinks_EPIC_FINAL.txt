📖 Why This Matters (Narrative Hook)
“Most families navigating autism won’t ask for help. But when someone offers the right kind of support—it can change everything.”
“This toolkit gives supporters a gentle way in. And when we pass it on, we build a world where care spreads naturally.”

---

🧠 Ripple Archetypes (Supporter Sharing Styles)

🕊️ The Encourager:
> “I thought of you—you’re always someone who lifts others up. This toolkit just fits your kind heart.”

🔍 The Explainer:
> “This answered questions I didn’t even know how to ask. I thought it might help someone else too.”

🔁 The Pay-it-Forwarder:
> “Someone shared this with me. It helped. I’m passing it on just in case it helps you too.”

🔥 The Activator:
> “This made me want to be a better friend. Maybe it’ll move you too.”

Use archetypes to shape the tone of ripple messages based on user intent.

🎯 Ripple Share Challenge (Optional Micro CTA)

“Want to be a ripple-starter? Try sending this to 3 people who care about inclusion, kindness, or families.”

“You don’t need a big following. Just one person who might care.”

This can appear after a ripple card or invite is shared.

---

💬 Post-Share Reflections (Feedback Moments)

After a user sends or shares something:

> “You just helped someone else feel less lost. That ripple is real.”

> “Even if no one replies—you planted something.”

> “Small acts like this make big things possible.”

---

🖼️ Ripple Card Use Tags

Each ripple card can include suggested placements:

📸 Instagram caption  
🧾 Email footer or signature  
💬 Group chat message  
🖼️ Print-and-post encouragement card

These tags expand usefulness without extra instructions.

Together, these upgrades elevate sharing into a meaningful act of care and belonging.
