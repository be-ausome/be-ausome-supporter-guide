Seeing someone struggle in public—especially a child in distress—can feel confusing.

Here’s how to support without judgment:
1. Make space without staring.
2. Offer quietly: “Can I grab water or help in any way?”
3. If you’re close to the family, follow up later with care—not advice.

Compassion speaks volumes. Want a script for a gentle follow-up?
