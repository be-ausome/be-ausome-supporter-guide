Hey, it looks like we’ve hit an overwhelm moment. Let’s step back together:  

1. Pause and take three slow breaths (in for 4, out for 6).  
2. If you’d like, name *one* thing that feels hard right now—no pressure.  
3. When you’re ready, we’ll choose a single next step that feels doable.  

I’m here, and there’s no rush.
