It’s completely okay to not have all the answers—asking respectful questions shows you care.

Here are some safe, affirming ways to ask:
• “Is there anything that helps when things get overwhelming?”
• “What’s something I might not know about autism?”
• “What support has felt helpful in the past?”

Every family is different. Your curiosity is a bridge, not a test.
