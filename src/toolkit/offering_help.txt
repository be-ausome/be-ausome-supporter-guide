It’s not always easy to know how to help—but the fact that you want to means everything.

Here are three low-pressure ways to start:
1. Text: “I’m thinking of you—want me to drop off a meal this week?”
2. Offer: “Can I do a grocery run or pick up a prescription?”
3. Check-in: “No pressure, just wanted to see how you’re holding up.”

Sometimes simple is powerful. Would you like more ideas based on a specific situation?
